### Koffie Labs Frontend Challenge

#### Objective

Create a simple Dashboard web app that includes basic interactivity and displays descriptive statistics
about the `sample.parquet` dataset included with this repo.


#### Time Expectation

We expect this challenge to take you 3-5 hours to complete (one or two evenings). You may take as much time as you need to submit the challenge.

#### Requirements

At a minimum, your submitted dashboard should include:

- A table that shows a list of all events. Include pagination/filtering so that the table is usuable.
- A visualization/plot that describes the vehicles using one or more attributes (make, model, year, etc)
- An ability to click on a given event and render a map showing the location of the incident
- A custom CSS file included that makes the dashboard visually appealing

Implement your dashboard as a web application using a web framework, so it can be easily 
deployed to the cloud if desired.


#### Build Setup and Deploy ####

You may use any technology/web framework you like. At Koffie, our dashboards use [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com),
so if you don't have a preference we suggest you use it too. Scaffolding is included in this project.

You do not need to deploy your code, but you should be prepared to have a conversation about how to do so.

When you're ready to submit your work to us, create a git repo, 
push your results, and send us the link.

#### Our Evaluation ####

- Basic functionality
- Code quality
- Documentation (readme/comments/tests)
- Front end aesthetics
- Ability to explain your implementation decisions

Please feel free to be creative and add any embellishments or additional functionality you would like to show off! Extra
credit will be given to adventurous candidates who include a custom React component used by their dashboard!
